# Blender Files
These are the files I used to bake out the textures.

Stud.blend is the raw stud with all the modifiers unapplied so you can modify it to your needs.  

Stud Bakes.blend is the file with all the final models I used to bake the diffuse maps and normal maps.  
For the diffuse maps I changed all of the models Z Scale to 0.75, and baked an ambient occlusion map. Then in Gimp I applied a brightness shift of -20 and a contrast shift of 20.
