# Combining Normals

This is a helper Node.js script I created to properly combine two normal maps.

Setup Commands (make sure you have node.js installed):
npm init
npm install three
npm install jimp

Running:
Set the files paths and desired MIX_FACTOR in the combine.mjs script.
then run node combine.mjs
