# Combining Normals

This is a helper Node.js script I created to properly combine two normal maps.

Setup Commands (make sure you have node.js installed):  
npm init  
npm install three  
npm install jimp  

Running:  
Set the files paths and desired MIX_FACTOR in the combine.mjs script.  
then run node combine.mjs
